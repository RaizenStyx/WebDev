<h1>Operational Technical Professional</h1>

<p>I work for McDonalds, and working for them for over 10 years has provided me with some special training. They are one of the one fast food chains that
allow their people to work with the techology within the store. Back in October of 2019, I was given the oppurtunity to attend one of their classes that 
given even more training in this field. They sometimes refer to these people as OTP3's, and are given the training to fix most networking errors within 
the stores to reduce time on the phone with the helpdesk. It is now considered a school that gives some college credits.</p>
